# DDogZip

DDogZip is a tool designed to facilitate local development by converting DataDog-style traces into Zipkin formats.

It allows developers to debug and analyze their traces locally without the need to transmit data to DataDog's infrastructure.

This tool is not intended to replace DataDog, but rather to enhance the debugging process during development phases where local trace analysis is required.

## Getting Started


### Configuration

DDogZip can be configured using environment variables as follows:

`DDTRACE_PORT`: Port to listen for Datadog client requests (default: 8126)
`ZIPKIN_HOST`: Hostname for the Zipkin collector (default: localhost)
`ZIPKIN_PORT`: Port for the Zipkin collector (default: 9411)
`LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (warn, info, error, debug) (default: info)

### Running Locally

To start the application, run:

mix run --no-halt

### Runnin with Docker
```bash
docker run \
    -p 8126:8126 \
    -e DDTRACE_PORT=8126 \
    -e ZIPKIN_HOST=localhost \
    -e ZIPKIN_PORT=9411 \
    ddogzip
```

Make sure to adjust the ZIPKIN_HOST, ZIPKIN_PORT, and LOG_LEVEL environment variables according to your Zipkin configuration and logging preferences.
